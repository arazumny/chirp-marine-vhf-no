Chirp (http://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home) file for Norwegian VHF marine channels.

Original file (MARINE_VHF_UHF_INTERNATIONAL_2016B.csv) from https://radiofreeq.wordpress.com/2016/02/20/marine-channel-frequencies-vhf-uhf-radio-programming/ didn't seem to match Norwegian channels.

New data (Kanalbruk.htm) from http://trudelutt.com/linker/vhf_kanaler_nor.htm will be used to modify original file.
