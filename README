Improved Chirp (http://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home) file for VHF marine channels.

Original file (MARINE_VHF_UHF_INTERNATIONAL_2016B.csv) from https://radiofreeq.wordpress.com/2016/02/20/marine-channel-frequencies-vhf-uhf-radio-programming/ and the stock "Marine VHF channels" did not match marine channel numbers with baofeng channel numbers.

Fixing with Kanalbruk.htm from http://trudelutt.com/linker/vhf_kanaler_nor.htm as source.

I'm not sure where L and F channels are usually placed, so I put them at 10x and 11x. Let me know if there's a standard numeric location for them.

Also removed all Skip flags, as I'd like all channels to be scanned.

TODO:
* Check if Chirp wants to use this as new generic maritime config.
